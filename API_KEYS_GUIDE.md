## üîë Anthropic Claude API

### Important: Pro Plan vs API Access

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** The Anthropic **Pro Plan** ($20/month for claude.ai) is **NOT the same** as API access!

- **API Access**: Separate pay-as-you-go pricing for developers

### Getting Your Anthropic API Key

1. **Create an Account**
   - Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Sign up for a free account (no credit card required initially)

2. **Add Credits**
   - Navigate to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing
   - Click "Add Credits" or "Purchase Credits"
   - Minimum purchase is typically $5
   - Credits never expire

3. **Create API Key**
   - Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   - Click "Create Key"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "GTD Chatbot")
   - **Copy the key immediately** (you won't see it again!)
   - Format: `sk-ant-api03-...`

4. **Add to Your .env File**
   ```bash
   LLM_PROVIDER="anthropic"
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-your-key-here"
   ```

   - OpenAI: Set hard/soft limits in billing settings
   - OpenRouter: Set spending limits

3. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Delete old keys you're not using
   - Create new keys every few months

4. **Monitor usage**
   - Check your provider's dashboard weekly
   - Watch for unexpected spikes

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

After adding your API key:

1. **Restart the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the chat** at http://localhost:5173/chat

3. **Test with a simple message**:
   ```
   "Create a task to test the chatbot"
   ```

4. **Check for errors**:
   - Browser console (F12)
   - Backend terminal logs
