# Chatbot Quick Start Guide

## Setup in 3 Steps

### 1. Configure Your LLM Provider

Edit `backend/.env` and add your LLM configuration:

```bash
# Choose your provider
LLM_PROVIDER="anthropic"  # Options: anthropic, openai, openrouter

# Add your API key (choose one based on your provider)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
# OR
# OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# OR
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..."
```

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- Backend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Open the Chat

1. Log in to your GTD app
2. Click the "ðŸ’¬ Chat" link in the navigation header
3. Start chatting with your task assistant!

## Example Conversations

```
You: "Create a task to buy groceries tomorrow"

Assistant: âœ“ Task created: Review the code (importance: 5)

You: "Remind me to call mom next week"
Assistant: âœ“ Task created: Call mom (planned for next week)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Chat not working?
